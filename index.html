<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>
    As i said earlier my name is olive am the first born of my family. And i have very many siblings my dad has two wives so its alot of us.
    i started school when i was three years old in a boarding school it was so hard but i had no one that time so dad had to drop in school
    for him to continue his job. so i attended school in uganda since primary to secondary school.
    its an experience honestly  joined the Rwandan enviroment in 2016 to join school this side.
    that was the worst experience
    but last i got used to the enviroment and catched up with others learnt the language it was so hard for me to get the language but thank thee am good. i can clap to myself.

   <h3>WHY JOIN THE PROGRAM</h3>
    <p>
        when i was in a primary school i loved computer so much i really wanted to do computer based course but unfortunately i didnt get the chance of engaging in it in primary. when i joined secondary. i got lost within my dream and lost intrest and enjoyed other stuff. i did HEG in my a'level and there i lost it all. so when i finished school in 2018 i sat down and told myself which dream did you achieve that
        when you was a little kid. That forced me to chase this dream and here iam. i have a cousin who is into programming alot and she made love 
        even love it more. <strong>i really need a wide market on whatever i will do in my future cause we dont know 
        our tomorrow</strong>.
